    <p>The 1980's was my start into the world of video games. ET was....well it's here because it's what almost destroyed the video game industry. Thankfully the failure came early and
       video games rebounded with Nintendo. Link was the first game I could save on; and I played it before Zelda. I was sold on side scrolling games after that,
      que Super Mario 3, the game was full of replayability and secrects. Also having a movie that featured the game didn't hurt.

      <p>The 1990's brought in the console wars, and I sided with Sega, Sonic was a fast hyper fun game with a great sound track. After cutting my losses and going back to nitendo, Mario 64 
         gave me days of fun trying to find all the 120 stars. Finally I settled on PlayStation, Castlevania SOTN was the best for sequence breaking but also gave rise to a new
         subclass of games, the metrovanias. </p>

        All of the games have a common thread of music, the 2000's really pushed what we expected to hear.
        God of war, bought a new kind of action game, story telling and epic fights. Kingdom Hearts expaned on the normal open world was the one of the first to reward a person for 
        completing the game at 100% for the best ending.  I can't talk about games in the 2000's without talking about the game that defines MMORPG. The game is massive, and with 
        community pushed content WoW made video consoles step up to provide a better online gaming experience.

     <p> I only had time for a few games in the past years, so I made it count. The 2010s brought us huge open world games with endless side quest. Red Dead 2 and The Witcher 3 
        being the best of them. A person could either finish the game or just do side quest for 100's of hours. Both games pushed what a game should be, with amazing graphics and 
        top notch voice actors. They were so good that new games are still being compaired to them.

     <p>The 2020's are bringing with them the Nostalgia! Awesome remakes and a return to the classic play styles. Across the industry games being pushed to offer more than just size and scoop. 
        I feel that this next 10 years is going to bring old classics to life while improving them as well. For example making FF7 not be turn based was a way to make it feel brand new. 
        Resident Evil 8 is going for the original feel, going back to the slow bulid up and not just a run and gun. I can not wait to see what comes next.
